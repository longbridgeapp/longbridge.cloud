However, due to factors such as the limited budget for technical input and insufficient IT human resources, the FD brokerage not only needed to afford massive costs of local computer room maintenance and system procurement but also could not provide individual users with mobile internet services such as App, news information, and real-time quotes. Therefore, users could only place orders by calling brokers, which significantly limited its business development. In order to meet the growing online investment needs of its individual users, the FD brokerage chooses to use Whale's services,  providing users with a trading app where users can view quotes and portfolios in real-time, and can also obtain more investment information through News and Community. While optimizing the user experience, the FD brokerage also improved the user retention rate, gained a large number of new users, and achieved new highs in trading revenue.",
